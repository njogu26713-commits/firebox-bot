## ℹ️ About Firebox Bot

Firebox Bot is a lightweight, customizable WhatsApp automation and userbot utility built on top of the `@whiskeysockets/baileys` library. It enables single or multi-user interaction with automated moderation, utility search commands, funny filters, media converters, and AI assistants. It is optimized to run efficiently on low-resource environments (like VPS or Render Free tier) without memory leaks or CPU crashes.

<summary><b>🚀 Deploy on Render.com (Collapsible Setup Guide)</b></summary>

### 1. Push to GitHub
Fork or push this repository to your own GitHub account.

### 2. Create a Web Service
- Go to [Render.com](https://render.com) and sign in.
- Click **New +** and select **Web Service**.
- Connect your GitHub repository.

### 3. Build & Start Settings
- **Runtime**: `Node`
- **Build Command**: `npm install`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`

### 4. Set Environment Variables
In the **Environment** settings tab, add the following variables:
- `SESSION_ID`: The base64 gzip-compressed session credentials string (e.g. `FIREBOX~...`) generated in your local console when you ran the bot and logged in.
- `PORT`: Set to `10000` (Render's default web service port).
- `SUDO`: Your primary WhatsApp manager number (e.g., `254712345678`).

### 5. Keep Alive (Prevent Sleep)
Render's Free Tier spins down web services if there is no inbound traffic for 15 minutes.
- Copy your Render Web Service URL (e.g., `https://your-bot.onrender.com`).
- Add it to a free uptime monitor service (like **UptimeRobot**, **Better Stack**, or **cron-job.org**) to ping the URL every 5 to 10 minutes. This hits the bot's internal heartbeat server (`app.get("/")`) and keeps the process online 24/7!
